## My projects
I made stuff in a lot of languages, doing a lot of things, over a long time period. Here are some of my favorite ones:
 - [Oh es](https://github.com/pitust/ohes_root), an OS written in rust (archived)
 - A [bunch](https://github.com/pitust/JSSI) of [JS to native](https://github.com/pitust/jstcc) [compilers](https://pwnfunction.com).
 - [js-os](https://github.com/pitust/js-os), the most cursed OS i made (**in JS**)
 - [WeKernel](https://github.com/pitust/wekernel) is a neat kernel written in AssemblyScript, compiled to natice, booted with limine.
 - [diodeOS](https://github.com/pitust/diode) is an older D os.
 - [stivalebios](https://github.com/pitust/stivalebios) is a trash BIOS that is at least 10000x better than @atieP's [atiebios](https://github.com/atieP/atiebios)
