# Do open platforms benefit the user?
An open platform is a platform where the user is in control and is not limited to the features that the original vendor has bestowed upon the users. Anyone is free to
make applications for an open platform. I wanted to discuss the benefits and detriments of these open platforms to the end user, because open platforms, as well as
repairability and privacy, are big topics recently.

## Benefits of open platforms
Open platforms have a fundamental benefit to the user: open platforms allow for users to install any modification they want. This means more applications and freedom to the end users. This freedom permits users to have more fun with their own devices.

As an example, there are many customization options that users can install that are only possible on android: custom launchers, icon packs, and more are only available on android (as well as iOS devices that are _jailbroken_, which allows the user to install system tweaks).
Open platforms also prevent censorship: apps can be distributed outside of the official app stores, and therefore cannot be taken down at the whim of a company.
You can control the platform, be it software or hardware further, to make it fit your exact workflow^[2]^. 

A closed platform can leave you in a situation where the desired task is _not possible_: if the platform you are forced to use does not have a specific feature, and
there is no way for an addon that allows for the desired task to be added then you may be stuck with a much more difficult than necessary solution.

Open platforms are supported by a community of developers all over the world, rather than a single company. They are themselves generally offered for free, and do not require payment. 

Interestingly, there exist efforts to give the user more control and thus open closed platforms more - iOS devices can be jailbroken as mentioned before, however 
other closed platforms like game consoles have been hacked over the years to allow users to be able to run their own software. Most 
major game consoles to date have been hacked in this way. The legality of such action is questionable however^[4]^.

## Detriments of open platforms
Open platforms have not only benefits, but also risks and dangers.

Open platforms typically contain more security and stability risks: on open platforms, the user may break their system a lot more. In addition to that, the user may be able
to unintentionally install malware, spyware, and other malicious software. Android has 15-47x the infections as iOS, which is a more closed ecosystem^[1]^. There is
also another factor in the form of software piracy, which is not easily done on iOS, but can be trivially performed on android devices. They are also more effort to
manage, as you need to release more samples, documentation, and other internal details about the platform to the users.

Because of the fact that the developers are technical, the platforms are often not designed with beginner-friendliness in mind.
As an example, while on Windows the "notepad" application is fairly straightforward to use, on Linux the "vim" text editor requires complex bespoke keyboard
combinations that are not very user-friendly.

Open platforms often have worse support services - a big company like Microsoft or Apple can spend a lot more resources supplying information and hiring
support staff to help the user fix any issue they encounter^[3]^, while a group of volunteers does not have such resources.

Open platforms may not necessarily be whole ecosystems. You may be able to do everything, but a lot of seemingly basic
features are unavailable.

## Conclusion
In general, You can see open platforms have benefits and detriments, and whether or not the tradeoff is worth it is
a question that everyone should answer for themselves.

Certain organisations may prefer different tradeoffs. For example, a bank might prefer a closed system with its better 
support while a big web platform would likely use an open platform like Linux.

I am an advanced user, and I value customizability a lot. Therefore, I personally think the tradeoff of malware and software piracy is acceptable. However, to a big company like Apple that makes money
from app store transactions, malware and especially piracy are big problems for them. It is understandable that a less technical user might prefer to use a simpler
experience and won't necessarily use the extra customization features more open platforms provide.

 - It's not coming from a neutral source - Apple owns a pretty closed platform and as such is not neutral
 - It states the opinion, that sideloading (which is an important part of an open platform) is detrimental to security.
