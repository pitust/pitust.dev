# ~~Opinions~~ Statements of pure fact

 - GPLv3 is a license created by microsoft who secretly took over the FSF to defraud the free software community with GPLv4.
 - The hypocritic license is the only license that can save us from evil megacorporations.
 - Open source is a fictional movement created by the Close-Source Sect (CSS), made up of big name companies to snuff out anyone not working for them.

All of these are my genuine opinions, and are not jokes. I am a serious individual who never jokes.
